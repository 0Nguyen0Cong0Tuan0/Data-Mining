**Data Mining Definition**: **Data mining**, also referred to as **knowledge discovery from data (KDD)**, is the process of **extracting interesting**, **non-trivial**, **implicit**, **previously unknown**, and **potentially useful patterns** or knowledge from a huge amount of data. It is an automated analysis of massive datasets. Data mining is driven by the necessity to convert data into knowledge. Keep in mind that simple search and query processing, and deductive expert systems are not data mining.

KDD Process: Data mining plays an essential role in the knowledge discovery process. The KDD process includes data cleaning, data integration, data selection, transformation, data mining, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation.
◦
Some view it as including data pre-processing (data integration, normalization, feature selection, dimension reduction) and post-processing (pattern evaluation, pattern selection, pattern interpretation, pattern visualization).
◦
Web mining, for example, includes data cleaning, data integration from multiple sources, warehousing the data, data cube construction, data selection for data mining, data mining, and presentation of the mining results.
◦
The patterns and knowledge discovered can be used or stored into a knowledge-base.
•
Evolution of Data Mining: Data mining evolved with the growth of database technology and represents a confluence of multiple disciplines. These include machine learning, statistics, pattern recognition, database technology, high-performance computing, visualization, and algorithm development. The evolution of science has moved from empirical, to theoretical, to computational, and now to data science.
•
Data Types: Data mining can be applied to a variety of data. These include:
◦
Database data (extended-relational, object-oriented, heterogeneous, legacy)
◦
Data warehouse
◦
Transactional data
◦
Stream data
◦
Spatiotemporal data
◦
Time-series data
◦
Sequence data (including bio-sequences)
◦
Text and web data
◦
Multimedia data
◦
Graphs and social and information networks
•
Data Mining Functions: Several data mining functions can be performed:
◦
Characterization: involves generalizing, summarizing, and contrasting data characteristics.
▪
For example, describing the characteristics of a "dry" region versus a "wet" region.
◦
Discrimination: involves generalizing, summarizing, and contrasting data characteristics.
◦
Association Analysis: Discovering frequent patterns or items purchased together.
▪
For example, the association rule "Diaper → Beer [0.5%, 75%]" indicates that customers who buy diapers also frequently buy beer.
◦
Correlation Analysis: Discovering relationships between data elements.
◦
Classification: Constructing models (functions) based on training examples to describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction.
▪
For example, classifying countries based on climate or cars based on gas mileage.
◦
Prediction: Constructing models (functions) based on training examples to predict some unknown class labels.
◦
Cluster Analysis: Grouping data to form new categories (clusters) based on maximizing intra-class similarity and minimizing inter-class similarity.
▪
For example, clustering houses to find distribution patterns.
◦
Outlier Analysis: Identifying data objects that do not comply with the general behavior of the data.
▪
Useful for fraud detection and rare events analysis.
◦
Trend and Evolution Analysis: Analyzing trends, time-series data, and deviations, such as regression and value prediction.
▪
An example of sequential pattern mining is observing that customers who first buy a digital camera later purchase large SD memory cards.
◦
Structure and Network Analysis: Includes graph mining, social network analysis, and web mining.
•
Knowledge Evaluation: Because one can mine a tremendous amount of patterns and knowledge, not all mined knowledge is interesting and evaluation is needed. Evaluation can be based on factors such as coverage, typicality vs. novelty, accuracy, and timeliness.
•
Applications: Data mining has wide ranging applications. These include:
◦
Web page analysis
◦
Recommender systems
◦
Targeted marketing
◦
Biological and medical data analysis
◦
Software engineering
•
Major Issues: Key challenges in data mining include:
◦
Mining methodology
◦
User interaction
◦
Efficiency and scalability
◦
Diversity of data types
◦
Social impacts
•
History of Data Mining Society: Data Mining has a history of conferences and journals.
◦
Examples of conferences include: ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining (KDD), SIAM Data Mining Conf. (SDM), (IEEE) Int. Conf. on Data Mining (ICDM).
◦
Examples of journals include: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DAMI or DMKD), IEEE Trans. On Knowledge and Data Eng. (TKDE), KDD Explorations, ACM Trans. on KDD.
