### **Data Mining Definition**

**Data mining**, also referred to as **knowledge discovery from data (KDD)**, is the process of **extracting** interesting, non-trivial, implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful **patterns or knowledge from a huge amount of data**.

It is an automated analysis of massive datasets. **Data mining is driven by the necessity to convert data into knowledge**.

**Important distinction**: 

**The KDD process is broader than data mining itself**. Data mining is just **one step** in the KDD process, which **includes pre-processing** (cleaning, integration, selection, transformation), **data mining**, and **post-processing** (evaluation, interpretation, visualization).

**Keep in mind** that **simple search and query processing, and deductive expert systems are not data mining**.

### **KDD Process**

**Data mining** plays **an essential role** in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. 

The KDD process consists of **several steps**:

üßº **Data Cleaning**: Removing noise and inconsistencies.

üß© **Data Integration**: Combining multiple data sources.

ü´≥**Data Selection**: Extracting relevant data.

üçÇ **Data Transformation**: Normalization, feature selection, and dimension reduction.

‚õèÔ∏è **Data Mining**: Applying algorithms to extract patterns.

‚úÖ **Pattern Evaluation**: Assessing discovered patterns based on usefulness.

üé® **Knowledge Presentation**: Visualizing and interpreting results.

**Some view** it as including **additional pre-processing** (e.g., normalization, feature selection) and **post-processing** (e.g., pattern evaluation, pattern visualization).

**Example: Web Mining Process**

- Evolution of Data Mining

**Data mining has evolved along with database technology and represents a confluence of multiple disciplines, including:**
- Machine Learning
- Statistics
- Pattern Recognition
- Database Technology
- High-Performance Computing
- Visualization
- Algorithm Development


**The evolution of science** has moved from: **1. Empirical ‚Üí 2. Theoretical ‚Üí 3. Computational ‚Üí 4. Data Science**

### **Types of Data for Mining**

**Data mining** can be applied to **various types of data**, including:
- Database data (extended-relational, object-oriented, heterogeneous, legacy)
- Data warehouses
- Transactional data
- Stream data
- Spatiotemporal data
- Time-series data
- Sequence data (e.g., bio-sequences)
- Text and web data
- Multimedia data

- Graphs, social, and information networks

### **Data Mining Functions**

**Several key functions** of data mining include:

1.$\space$ **Characterization & Discrimination**

**Characterization**: summarizing data characteristics.

- Example: Describing characteristics of a "dry" vs. "wet" region.

**Discrimination**: contrasting different data groups.

- Example: Differentiating high-income vs. low-income customers.

2.$\space$ **Association & Correlation Analysis**

**Association**: discovering frequent patterns or co-occurring items.
- Example: **Diaper ‚Üí Beer [0.5%, 75%]** means 0.5% of transactions contain both, and when a diaper is bought, there‚Äôs a 75% chance beer is also purchased.

**Correlation**: finding relationships between data attributes.

3.$\space$ **Classification & Prediction**

**Classification**: constructing models to categorize data into predefined classes.

- Example: Classifying emails as spam or not.

**Prediction**: estimating future values based on past data.

- Example: Predicting house prices based on features.

**Key Difference**: 

- **Classification predicts categories**, while **Prediction estimates continuous values**.

4.$\space$ **Clustering & Outlier Analysis**

**Clustering**: grouping data into clusters based on similarity.

- Example: Customer segmentation in marketing.

**Outlier Detection**: identifying abnormal data points.

- Example: Fraud detection, medical diagnosis, cyber attack detection.

5.$\space$ **Trend & Evolution Analysis**

Detecting sequential patterns, time-series trends, and evolution.

- Example: Customers who buy cameras often later purchase SD cards.

6.$\space$ **Structure & Network Analysis**

Graph mining, social network analysis, and web mining.

### **Knowledge Evaluation**

Since a massive number of patterns can be mined, **evaluation is essential**. **Criteria for evaluating patterns**:
- **Coverage**: How much data the pattern applies to.
- **Novelty vs. Typicality**: Whether the pattern is new or confirms existing knowledge.
- **Accuracy**: Predictive performance.
- **Timeliness**: How relevant and up-to-date the pattern is.

### **Applications of Data Mining**

Data mining has **widespread applications**, such as:

- Web page analysis
- Recommender systems
- Targeted marketing
- Biological and medical data analysis
- Software engineering
- Fraud detection

### **Major Issues in Data Mining**
Some **key challenges in data mining** include:
- **Mining Methodology**: Developing more accurate, scalable algorithms.
- **User Interaction**: Making results interpretable and actionable.
- **Efficiency & Scalability**: Handling large, complex datasets efficiently.
- **Diversity of Data Types**: Mining structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

**Social Impact & Ethics**:
- **Privacy & Security**: Protecting personal data from misuse.
- **Bias & Fairness**: Avoiding discrimination in AI-driven models.
